INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

Something is wrong with article voting! The business unit
says that sometimes voting just stops working. They need you
to take a look at see if you can fix it.

Be sure to fix any other problems you find and write down an explanation
for each change.

The file bonnier_test.php is the code for a voting web service. It is called like this:
bonnier_test.php?article_id=1&vote_value=1 

It will return the markup for a voting widget. Pretend like this markup is included directly onto a page.



RULES

--------------------------------------------------

You can't replace any functionality with third party libraries.

Pretend like this code is already in production. Be sure to design 
your changes for deployment to a production environment with existing 
vote data.



INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------

You will need mysql 5.x and a web server with php 5.x


1) Create the database using the included sql file.

2) Modify the mysql_connect statement in bonnier_test.php with your mysql login / pass
